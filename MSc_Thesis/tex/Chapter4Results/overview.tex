\chapter{Results}

In this chapter we will be discussing the results of simulations of the CA model as applied to the case study discussed in the previous chapter. We will explore what impact the following have on the results: grid size, 
number of carcinogens, ethanol and nicotine concentration, excising the tumour versus excising the entire field, and earlier excision versus later excision. 

We will discuss field growth, changes in probabilities of phenotypic actions over time, mutation spread rates, and the number of lineages. By tracking lineages we will also check monoclonal versus polyclonal origins.
