\chapter{Application and Implementation}

Though field cancerization is found in many types of tissue throughout the body, the most commonly studied case is head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is the case study we will use to test the model proposed in the previous chapter. Ethanol and nicotine are the most commonly associated carcinogens to HNSCC, thus we consider them in this chapter. These two carcinogens typically enter the body through smoking and/or chewing tobacco and drinking alcohol, respectively.

In this chapter we will discuss how the parameters for the model were chosen for this case study. As well as how the model was implemented in parallel and the difficulties that arose in that process.
