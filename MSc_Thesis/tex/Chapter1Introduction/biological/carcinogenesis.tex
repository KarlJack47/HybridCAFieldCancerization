\subsection{Carcinogenesis}

Most carcinogenesis models consider that cancer is initialized from the result of a multi-step process. A normal cell does not become a cancer cell until multiple genetic alterations accumulate within it. The number of genetic alterations in a cancer cell is an indicator of the level of malignancy of the cell. 

\textcite{Gatenby} found six micro-environmental barriers for a malignant phenotype: apoptosis with loss of basement membrane contact, inadequate growth promotion, senescence (deterioration of a cells' power of division and growth with age), hypoxia (deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues), acidosis (excessively acidic condition of the body fluids or tissues), and ischaemia (restriction of blood supply to tissues, causing hypoxia). The development of cancer occurs when a normal cell overcomes at least one of these barriers. Thus, the micro-environment is an important factor to consider in cancer initialization. 

A normal cell lineage can acquire epimutations, termed mutations in \textcite{Curtius}, that are positively selected in the micro-environment of a healthy organ. Not only do carcinogens cause mutations, the natural aging process of tissue can as well, because mutations accrue in such tissues \parencite{Blokzijl}. Considering that all mutant cells are cancerized, the entire body becomes increasingly cancerized as it grows older \parencite{Curtius}. A driver mutation is one that confers growth or survival advantages for tumour cells within the appropriate micro-environment \parencite{Calabrese,MGreaves,Stratton}. A passenger (neutral) mutation is one that passively accumulates in cell lineages  \parencite{Calabrese,MGreaves,Stratton}. It may be that some driver mutations are not currently affecting cancer growth but instead had previously driven the growth of an ancestral lineage \parencite{Curtius}. Progression to cancer usually requires the accumulation of multiple driver mutations \parencite{Weaver}. A mutant lineage/clone, can grow to produce large patches, or fields, of cells that are predisposed to eventually progress to neoplasm. 

The stromal micro-environment is a key regulator of self-renewal in the epithelium \parencite{Davis}. Epithelium is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with connective, muscle and nervous tissue \cite{clevelandclinic.org}. Epithelial tissues line the outer surfaces of organs and blood vessels throughout the body, as well as the inner surfaces of cavities in many internal organs \cite{clevelandclinic.org}. Epithelial tissue is organized into two different types: glandular and squamous \cite{clevelandclinic.org}. A gland is one or more cells that produce and secrete a specific product \cite{clevelandclinic.org}. Glandular tissue has two types: exocrine (secrete their products (enzymes, mucus, milk, \etc) into ducts that lead directly to the external environment), endocrine glands (secrete their products (hormones) directly into the bloodstream) \cite{leeds.ac.uk}. Exocrine glandular epithelium tissues include salivary glands, the esophagus, gastric glands, intestinal glands, pancreatic glands, mammary glands, and sweat glands \cite{leeds.ac.uk}. Examples of endocrine glandular tissues include pituitary glands, thyroid glands, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, pancreas, gonads, and pineal glands \cite{leeds.ac.uk}. Squamous epithelium tissue is a single layer of flat cells in contact with the basal lamina of the epithelium \cite{biologyonline.com}. It is often permeable and occurs where small molecules need to pass quickly through membranes via filtration or diffusion \cite{biologyonline.com}. Some examples of squamous tissue include the skin, walls of capillaries, linings of the pericardial, pleural cavities, peritoneal cavities, and linings of the alveoli of the lungs \cite{biologyonline.com}. The tissue architecture constrains evolution by limiting the ability of mutant clones to expand \parencite{Martens}, so understanding the differences between mutant clone expansions in glandular and squamous tissue is important. In glandular epithelium a mutant clone undergoes niche successions, where a mutant stem cell (SC) in the gland replaces all other SCs; after which the mutant glands produces a field of mutant glands by gland fission \parencite{Baker,LGreaves,McDonald,Nicholson}. Epithelial cells within a squamous tissue expand by basal replacement of neighbouring SCs \parencite{Klein,Alcolea,Clayton,Doupe}. During normal homeostasis basal cells proliferate to produce differentiated progeny that then form the superficial layers of the epithelium \parencite{Teixeira}. Any new basal cells compete to grow a patch by lateral replacement of one progenitor cell by another \parencite{Teixeira}. 

Phenotypic change is caused by either individual high-impact mutations or epistasis among a group of mutations that require each other \parencite{Curtius}. As well, large-scale mutational events that simultaneously alter expansive parts of the genome will elicit phenotypic change \parencite{Li,Stachler}. Micro-environmental factors provide selective pressures for phenotype adaptation in which cells explore the adaptive landscape (via genetic mutations or phenotypic plasticity), and genotypes of lineages reflect the phenotype that survived \parencite{Curtius}. \textcite{Curtius} consider only phenotypes that are cancer-related when discussing cancer development and initiation, thus they exclude regions of tissue having DNA damage or passenger mutations and oncogene or tumour suppressor gene mutations that are not currently active. It is important to note that cancerized phenotypes may be subtle and/or lasting only for a short time \parencite{Curtius}, making them hard to detect. Phenotypic consequences of a driver mutation may be context dependent, so the existence of a driver mutation may not be sufficient to cause a phenotypic change in the current micro-environmental condition \parencite{Curtius}. Due to the fact that crypt fission is the main mechanism in glandular tissue development, a mutation that increases upregulation of crypt fission is a cause for carcinoma development or initialization \parencite{Curtius}. Mutations that help cells adhere to the basal membrane influence carcinoma development in squamous tissue because they will not allow those cells to migrate and differentiate, thus causing the mutated cells to expand and/or replace neighbouring cells \parencite{Curtius}.
